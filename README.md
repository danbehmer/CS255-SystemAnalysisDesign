# CS255-SystemAnalysisDesign
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass wanted to give users the ability to hone in their driving skills without going through the hassle of dealing with the DMV. They wanted a system designed that would give users the ability to schedule practice lessons, take practice exams, and schedule tests through the system.


What did you do particularly well?

Something that I felt as though I did particularly well was take into consideration all of the use cases that might be involved with the system. Having a good sense of what the user should need is key when developing systems.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise something from the documents, I would revise the Gantt chart. I would improve it by making it visually easier to follow, as right now it looks confusing and cluttered.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted and implemented the user's needs into the system, by placing myself in their shoes. It is extremely important to consider the user's needs when designing because the product/system is being built for them. Making sure that there are no holes left unfilled allows for a product that is not only utilized by the user, but also appreciated by them.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My main approach when designing software is to look at the grand scheme of things. Thinking questions like: how is this for, how will they use it, and if the system was for me, what would I like to see? These questions and analysis of design are the techniques that I would likely use in the future to design systems.
